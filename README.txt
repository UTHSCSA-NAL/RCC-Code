## MATLAB code for RCC: Robust Collaborative Clustering


## To perform RCC, simply unzip nmfv1_4.rar and run RCC.m. 
   

## To set up the experiments from scratch, run the following scripts:
	rcc_fea_num_ari.m: Identify the optimal number of clusters in terms of adjusted Rand Index;
	noise_est.m: Estimate the noise level in the data;
	RCC.m: Perform clustering.
	rcc_ttest.m: Compare the clusters by t test.
